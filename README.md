## About This Project
This project is on building a rudimentary obstacle avoidance system using a SparkFun Redboard and the Arduino IDE. The reason I started this project was my interest in unmanned ground vehicles (UGV). I wanted to get some experience in developing UGV systems and chose to build an obstacle avoidance robot. 

His name is RAMS... which doesn't stand for anything meaningful :sweat_smile:. My roommate coined the name and it just kind of stuck. Anyways, I'm making this repository public for two reasons: (1) To showcase my project (2) To assist others in their own projects. I hope that this repo can help others who share the same curiosity.
