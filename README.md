Note: I made a last minute decision to orient his camera the other way around which is why the images may not be consistent with each other. I found that the lidar occupied too much space in the camera frame. I will upload his code as soon as I gather all the necessary reference to the other repos I have used in the making of this project.

Here are some videos of ULTRON moving around the apartment. It is receiving commands from my PC which is connected to the onboard wifi of the Raspberry Pi. The camera is also publishing a stream of images onto the topic raspicam_node which we can access from the computer. I will add more details on how I got this work soon!
